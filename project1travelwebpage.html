        <h2>When to go to Copenhagen</h2>
        <p> Deciding when to go to Copenhagen depends on the type of experience you want to have. If you’re into doing more outdoors, visiting Legoland and having a full range of activities then visiting during Spring or Summer is best. Definitely go during Fall or Winter if you prefer less crowds. If you want the full festive holiday experience, visiting during November or December is ideal.<br>
<br>
We happened to be there towards end of November and absolutely loved being able to see all the <strong>Christmas markets and experience the cozy hygge feeling everywhere</strong>. It was also magical being able to see Christmas at Tivoli, an experience everyone should have at least once. Overall, anytime is great to visit Copenhagen, or better yet go back during a different season and have a completely different trip.<br>
<br>

        <h2>Is the Copenhagen Card worth it?</h2>
        <p>The card <em>is only worth it</em> if you plan to pack in a <strong>lot of places per day</strong>. However, there are things that can go wrong or happen during the trip. Alternatively, you may want to purchase a 24 hour all zone ticket or Citypass.<br>

        <h3 id="day1">Day 1: Christiansborg Palace, Walking Tour, and Christmas Markets</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Christianborg Palace</li>
            <li>Walking Tour: Kongens Nytorv, Amagertorv, Strøget, Indre By</li>
            <li>Nyhavn and Kongens Nytorv Christmas Markets</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        
        
        <h3 id="day2">Day 2: Bornholm Island</h3>
        <p>The island is quite small and you can drive the perimeter in about 3-4 hours. Dubbed the “Sunny Island” it’s typically very sunny, however we experienced overcast skies during our stay. Since we only had a day here, we chose just a few select sites and saved the rest for another trip.<br>
        <br>
        There are villages on the water around the perimeter of the island, with some sites in the middle. For this trip we focused on the northern part of the island, since the south is more known for its beaches. During our short stay, we stopped at Allinge, Gudhjem, Hammershus Castle Ruins, Osterlars Round Church and Svaneke. In order to enjoy the island in its entirety you need at least 3-4 nights here. We plan to go back during summer for a longer trip.<br>

        <h3 class="days345">Day 3: Travel Back to Copenhagen + Tivoli Gardens</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tivoli Gardens</li>
            <li>Nyhavn</li>
            <li>Christmas Market</li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <h3 class="days345">Day 4: Frederiksborg Castle</h3>
        <p><strong>Castle Gardens:</strong> We toured the gardens surrounding the castle last, since the inside was only open until 3pm. It was perfect timing because sunset was starting and it meant for magical fairytale views of the castle. What better than to see a glorious castle at sunset? I took this pretty seriously and spent quite a bit of time getting some shots of this prime moment.
