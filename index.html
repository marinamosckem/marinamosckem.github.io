        <!-- MENTAL HEALTH TOPIC; 7 WAYS TO BOOST IT-->
        
        <h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>
        
        <!-- INTRODUCTION-->
        <p><strong>Workouts</strong> have always helped us with our <em>mental health</em> — but that seems to be the case now more than ever. <br>
<br>
And, as we’ve been getting our home workouts and socially distanced runs in, we’ve been using a few different ways to make them even better for our mental and emotional state. <br>
<br>
We’re not talking about anything that’s too hard to do; just little tweaks here and there that you can try. These little tricks have been helping us, and we figured they might help you, too — no matter what emotions you’re going through.</p><br>

        <!-- WAYS TO BOOST IT-->
        <h3 id="ways">7 WAYS TO BOOST MENTAL HEALTH WITH A WORKOUT</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong> Set an intention. </strong> Before every workout, take a few deep breaths and then set an intention as to what it is you want to accomplish with your workout. Is there a specific emotion you’re feeling that you’d like to release? Are you wanting to take a break from something (or everything)? Are you looking to boost your mood — or do you want to feel a certain way, like strong or powerful or simply in flow? Figure exactly out what you want your workout to do for you before you start moving.</li><br> 
            <li><strong> Envision stress leaving your body. </strong>As you go through your workout, imagine releasing stress as you move. This is particularly good to do on a run or a walk — envision stress, anxiety, and any other emotion you’d like to release dissolving with every step you take.</li><br>
            <li><strong> Meditate after your workout. </strong>If you’re having trouble sitting down to meditate or making meditation a habit, consider making it part of your regular cool down. Usually your “monkey mind” is quieter after exercising, and it’s a great way to cap your workout on a mindful note.</li><br>
            <li><strong> Repeat a mantra. </strong>We’ve always been a fan of using empowering mantras to improve our workouts, but right now we’re liking phrases like “Let it go,” “It’s safe for me to relax,” and even simple words like “love” to help process big emotions and stress.</li><br>
            <li><strong> Pay attention to your inhale and exhale. </strong>Really focus on inhaling what you want more of in your life (joy, health, love, for example), and then releasing what you don’t want on your exhale (such as stress, fear, anxiety). If you can, visualize what you want actually coming in to your body; and what you don’t want leaving your body.</li><br>
            <li><strong> Embrace nature. </strong>If you’re able to exercise safely outside and away from others, then turn your next walk or run into its own meditation by focusing on everything around you. Feel the sun and wind on your face; notice how the light hits the trees and plants near you; listen to all of the sounds around you. Try to keep yourself as in the moment as you can and see what natural beauty you can find.</li><br>
            <li><strong> Choose your music mindfully. </strong>Are there any songs that speak to what you’re feeling? Or, is there a specific beat that seems to match the intensity of your emotions? Put on music that speaks to how you’re feeling — no matter if it’s “workout” music or not.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <!-- FITNESS MINDSET-->
        <br>
        <h2 id="mindset-title">Fitness Mindset</h2>
        
        <!-- INTRODUCTION-->
        <h3 id="mindset">Change your <em>WORDS</em> change your <em>MINDSET</em>:</h3>
        <p> <em>Words are powerful</em>. In a critical moment, they can motivate you or burst your bubble. And sometimes all you need to change your mindset is a new word.<br>
<br>
That’s what happened to Jane Meronuck, Experience Life’s production director, when she took up strength training in 2012.<br>
<br>
<em>“I had pretty serious back pain at the time,”</em> she recalls. Her coach, David Dellanave, explained that she would be performing regressions (a.k.a. easier versions) of standard moves to avoid further injury. <em>“While everyone else was hoisting heavy things off the floor, I was lifting light weights off raised blocks,”</em> she says. <em>“It was a little disheartening.”</em> <br>
<br>
One day, Meronuck’s program called for pull-ups — a move that was beyond her capabilities — and once again, Dellanave showed her a regression.<br>
<br>
<em>“You know, I’m starting to really dislike that word ‘regress,’”</em> Meronuck said as she stepped up to the bar. <em>“It makes me feel like I’m moving backward.”</em> After a couple of assisted pull-ups, she came up with a new word: <em>“What about pregress?”</em> she asked. <em>“That makes it sound like reaching my goal is just a matter of time.”</em><br>
<br>
Dellanave immediately saw her point and began adopting the phrase with all his clients.<br>
<br>
And Meronuck? In 2015, at 49 years old, she lifted those heavy weights — off the floor — when she competed in her <strong>first powerlifting competition</strong>. </p><br>
